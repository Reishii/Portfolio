-  There are various fitness apps on the market. All of the applications have different approaches in solving the problem of  maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Some applications go about solving this issue through having access to multiple workout routines, while others only focus on a diet tracker. Our solution for the problem of preserving a healthy lifestyle is to create a fitness social network that doesnâ€™t solely focus on workout routines or diet. It will utilize both features to create a new community.
- GymSpace is a social fitness app that encourages a nontoxic competitive environment for users looking to live a healthy lifestyle. Introducing a competitive aspect retains user interest as it brings out their natural tendencies to improve in those respective challenges. Users will also gain points for participating in these competitions/challenges and extra points for winning; they can see their point-based ranking against other users through a worldwide, local, and friends leaderboard. GymSpace also focuses on allowing a user to share their fitness journey through social media, as an outlet for users to grow with their community.

  -  Viewing the Public Profile Page  of another user.
  -  Messages tab and showing the single message thread.
  -  The user's own workout plans.

- We built our application on the Andriod platform. For designing the app, we used Flutter, which is Google's open source mobile UI framework which is programmed through the language Dart. We also used Google's Firebase for our app's database and user authentication.
